# Building Detection/zones using U-Net (Deep Learning)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements **building detection/Zones** from satellite imagery using a **U-Net** deep learning model. The U-Net architecture is widely used for **semantic segmentation** and is well-suited for extracting buildings from high-resolution aerial or satellite images.



## 🎯 Objectives
- **Segment buildings** from satellite/aerial images.
- Train a **U-Net model** on labeled building footprints.
- Perform **post-processing** to refine building boundaries.
- Evaluate model accuracy using **IoU (Intersection over Union), Dice Coefficient**.

## 📌 Dataset
- **Source**: [SpaceNet, DeepGlobe, OpenBuildings, etc.]
- **Format**: Images (TIFF/PNG) & Masks (Binary format where buildings = 1, background = 0)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizing images to a fixed size (e.g., **256x256** or **512x512**)
  - Normalization and augmentation (rotation, flipping, contrast adjustment, etc.)

## 🏗 Model Architecture (U-Net)
- **Encoder**: Convolutional layers with batch normalization and ReLU activation.
- **Bottleneck**: Lowest resolution representation before upsampling.
- **Decoder**: Upsampling layers with skip connections for fine-grained segmentation.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss.
- **Optimizer**: Adam with a learning rate of **1e-4**.




## 🏆 Evaluation Metrics
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground-truth masks.
- **Dice Coefficient**: Measures segmentation accuracy.



## 🔧 Dependencies
Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Main Libraries Used:
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Rasterio
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- GDAL (for geospatial data processing)

## 📊 Results & Visualization
- Model performance is evaluated using test images.
- The segmented buildings are overlaid on the original images for visualization.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Use **higher resolution images** for better accuracy.
- Implement **post-processing techniques** (morphological operations, contour filtering).
- Experiment with other deep learning architectures like **DeepLabV3+, Mask R-CNN**.
